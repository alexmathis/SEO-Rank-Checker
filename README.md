# SEO-Rank-Checker
Check a website's rank in the first 100 results for a list of keywords.


To use this application, you will need a google custom search API key and a programable search engine ID. 
You can get the key here: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction
You can find the tutorial to create the custom search engine here: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse

Once you have both of these values, you can set the corresponding keys in the appsettings.json file. 

The API key should go in the GoogleAPIKey setting, and the custom search engine ID should go in GoogleCustomSearchAppID.
